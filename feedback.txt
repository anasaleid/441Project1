Hi Anas,
this is a well done homework. You used FunSuite for testing, well done!. Your code is well-commented
and you provided enough info in README. You used the for loop with mutable
variables even though you didn't have to - please think about how you can
modify your code to avoid doing it. It would be nice if you analuzed the results of your simulations. Yet, the quality of
the basic implementation is very good - you have the full grade, 5%.


Why do you call twice CloudSim.stopSimulation() in CloudSim3?
